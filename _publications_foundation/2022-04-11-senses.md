This article proposes a set of categories, each one representing a particular distillation of important statistical ideas. Each category is labeled a "sense" because we think of them as essential in helping every statistical mind connect in constructive and insightful ways with statistical theory, methodologies and computation. The illustration of each sense with statistical principles and methods provides a sensical (but not random) tour of the conceptual landscape of statistics, as a leading discipline in the data science ecosystem.
