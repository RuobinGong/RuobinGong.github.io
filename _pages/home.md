I'm an Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Rutgers University](https://www.stat.rutgers.edu/people-pages/faculty/people/403-robin-gong). Two branches of my research interests are 1) **foundations of uncertainty reasoning**: Bayesian and generalized Bayesian methodology and computation, random sets, imprecise probability, and Dempster-Shafer theory of belief function; and 2) **statistical privacy**: privacy-aware statistical inference and computational methodologies, and inference-aware privacy and disclosure mechanism design. I hold a status-only appointment with the Department of Statistical Sciences at the [University of Toronto](https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/people/directories/all-faculty/ruobin-gong). I am currently serving as an associate editor for the [Harvard Data Science Review](https://hdsr.mitpress.mit.edu) and a contributing column editor for the [IMS Bulletin](https://imstat.org/about-the-ims-bulletin/).
