I'm an Assistant Professor of Statistics at [Rutgers University](https://statistics.rutgers.edu/). My research interests lie at the foundations of uncertainty reasoning, Bayesian and generalized Bayesian methodology and computation, in particular random sets, imprecise probability, and Dempster-Shafer theory of belief function, as well as applications to robustness and privacy statistics.
