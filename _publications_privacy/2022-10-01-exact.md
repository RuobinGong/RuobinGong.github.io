This paper discusses how two classes of approximate computation algorithms can be adapted, in a modular fashion, to achieve exact statistical inference from differentially private data products. Considered are approximate Bayesian computation for Bayesian inference, and Monte Carlo Expectation-Maximization for likelihood inference. Up to Monte Carlo error, inference from these algorithms is exact with respect to the joint specification of both the analyst's original data model, and the curator's differential privacy mechanism. Highlighted is a duality between approximate computation on exact data, and exact computation on approximate data, which can be leveraged by a well-designed computational procedure for statistical inference.
